# Equirectangular local images viewer for Qgis

This plugin allows the visualization of equirectangular local images, although modifying the code, it can be used for any 360 image, given that the library [Marzipano](https://github.com/google/marzipano) is used.
 
[Example](https://github.com/All4Gis/EquirectangularViewer/tree/master/example)
 
## Prerequisites
 
The libraries [CefPython](https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython) is required, you can find them in:
- [x86](https://github.com/All4Gis/EquirectangularViewer/tree/master/ext-libs/x86/cefpython3)
- [x64](https://github.com/All4Gis/EquirectangularViewer/tree/master/ext-libs/x64/cefpython3)

These libraries must be placed in Windows `D:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\Lib\site-packages ` or something similar depending on your Qgis installation.

If you don't find this path ,are wrong or you are using other platform, open the python console of QGIS and try with this for print it:

`import site; site.getsitepackages()`
 
On the other hand, the plugin must be placed in the `.qgis` path, it should be something like 

 - Windows
 
 	`C:\Users\<username>\.qgis2\python\plugins`
 	
 - Linux
 
 	`/home/<username>/.qgis2/python/plugins`
 	
 - Mac OSX
 
 	`/Users/<username>/.qgis2/python/plugins`

If you don't find this path ,are wrong or you are using other platform, open the python console of QGIS and try with this for print it:

`print QgsApplication.qgisSettingsDirPath()`

and search the `python/plugins` folder in this path.
 
Once installed, you can test the correct functioning of the plugin with the example that is provided,a shapefile with some images.
 [Test Project](https://github.com/All4Gis/EquirectangularViewer/tree/master/Project_example)
 
 ### Note : 
 For show the images you need put the absolute path in the shapefile or modify the code ,method GetImage() in Geo360Dialog.py
 
## How it works?
 
It's simple:
- You start a local server in Python in  `http://127.0.0.1:1520/viewer.html `
- A copy of the image associated to the selected registry is created in the folder where our viewer and server are.
- With cefpython, we open the browser and return the current yaw to our canvas anytime the image is moved.
