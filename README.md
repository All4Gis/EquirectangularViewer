# Equirectangular local images viewer for Qgis

This plugin allows the visualization of equirectangular local images, although modifying the code, it can be used for any 360 image, given that the library [Marzipano](https://github.com/google/marzipano) is used.
 
[Example](https://github.com/All4Gis/EquirectangularViewer/tree/master/example)
 
## Prerequisites
 
The libraries [CefPython](https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython) is required and Pillow,  install the **cefpython3** python package and **Pillow**.
Always from command prompt:

`python3 -m pip install cefpython3`
`python3 -m pip install pillow`

Or using:

`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`


Once installed, you can test the correct functioning of the plugin with the example that is provided,a shapefile with some images.

## How it works?
 
It's simple:
- You start a local server in Python in  `http://127.0.0.1:1520/viewer.html `
- A copy of the image associated to the selected registry is created in the folder where our viewer and server are.
- With cefpython, we open the browser and return the current yaw to our canvas anytime the image is moved.
