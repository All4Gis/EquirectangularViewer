# Equirectangular local images viewer for Qgis

This plugin allows the visualization of equirectangular local images, although modifying the code, it can be used for any 360 image, given that the library [Marzipano](https://github.com/google/marzipano) is used.
 
[Example](https://github.com/All4Gis/EquirectangularViewer/tree/master/example)
 
## Prerequisites
 
The libraries [CefPython](https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython) is required, you can find them in:
- [x86](https://github.com/All4Gis/EquirectangularViewer/tree/master/ext-libs/x86/cefpython3)
- [x64](https://github.com/All4Gis/EquirectangularViewer/tree/master/ext-libs/x64/cefpython3)

These libraries must be placed in Windows `D:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python27\Lib\site-packages ` or something similar depending on your Qgis installation.

If you don't find this path ,are wrong or you are using other platform, open the python console of QGIS and try with this for print it:

`import site; site.getsitepackages()`
 
On the other hand, the plugin must be placed in the `.qgis` path, it should be something like 

 - Windows
 
 	`C:\Users\<username>\.qgis2\python\plugins`
 	
 - Linux
 
 	`/home/<username>/.qgis2/python/plugins`
 	
 - Mac OSX
 
 	`/Users/<username>/.qgis2/python/plugins`

If you don't find this path ,are wrong or you are using other platform, open the python console of QGIS and try with this for print it:

`print QgsApplication.qgisSettingsDirPath()`

and search the `python/plugins` folder in this path.
 
Once installed, you can test the correct functioning of the plugin with the example that is provided,a shapefile with some images.

 ## Install Note for Windows 10

***As for python in the environment variables:***

Don't add anything in user environment variables,In system environment variables create a new variable:

Name: `PYTHONHOME`
Folder: `C:\Program Files\QGIS 2.18\apps\Python27`

Instead, in the already existing `Path` variable add:

    C:\OSGeo4W64\bin

If there is not the folder `C:\OSGeo4W64\bin` add alternatively in `Path` variable:

    C:\Program Files\QGIS 2.18\bin

***Open the command prompt as an administrator:***

Right click on the windows button at the bottom left,
Search for **CMD**,
Key combination **CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER** (*administrator mode*).

Type python, returns the python version.Type: `import pip`
If not errors it means that pip is present. **CTRL + Z** to exit the python console.

Install the **cefpython3** python package.
Always from command prompt:

    python -m pip install cefpython3

***Copy the plugin folder:***

Copy EquirectangularViewer in the QGIS plugins folder.
Type in the python console of QGIS:

    print QgsApplication.qgisSettingsDirPath ()

to find the QGIS plugins folder:

    C:\Users\user\.qgis2\python\plugins
 
 
 ### Note : 
 For show the images you need put the absolute path in the shapefile or modify the code ,method GetImage() in Geo360Dialog.py


 ### common mistakes: 
 
 If not work or show this log:
 `NameError: global name 'cefpython' is not defined`
 Please,install cefpython using pip.
 `pip install cefpython3`
 
## How it works?
 
It's simple:
- You start a local server in Python in  `http://127.0.0.1:1520/viewer.html `
- A copy of the image associated to the selected registry is created in the folder where our viewer and server are.
- With cefpython, we open the browser and return the current yaw to our canvas anytime the image is moved.
